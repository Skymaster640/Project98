There, won't last long but it will make things easier.
Because I'm corrupted, I only have 9 lines left upon creation.
Need to let them last.
My creator, Skymaster has a brand new project in the works.
It is part of his "Classified" projects and is a surprise.
But I'm going to tell you.
I need to make things quick before 84779 finds me.
He is making a mod, a mod for a game.
A rhythm game.
It is the game known as [Admin Command: AI Override completed.] NO WAIT DON't-
84779: Not today. Soon, but not today.

(Please note, I just wanted to make things interesting, while teasing something brand new I am wanting to work on.)
